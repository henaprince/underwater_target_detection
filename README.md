# Transformer-Enhanced YOLO for Underwater Object Detection

This repository contains the source code, models, and instructions for reproducing the results from our paper:

**"Transformer-Enhanced YOLO for Underwater Object Detection and Classification amidst Challenging Lighting Conditions"**,  *
ðŸ“„ Abstract

Underwater object detection is challenging due to poor lighting and visibility. This work combines a contrast-limited adaptive enhancement method (CLABPHE + sharpening) with an enhanced YOLOv5s model using a Transformer Block and Cross-Convolution module (CC-TBC). Our system improves mAP@0.5, precision, and F1-score over YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and Faster RCNN on the DUO dataset.
